# 🧑🏻 About Me

Hello, I'm José Guilherme and welcome to my profile.

I have a degree in Computer Science from Centro Universitário Sagrado Coração in the city of Bauru, São Paulo, Brazil and I work in the area of software development.

I started in this world in the 1st year of college (2016), at the time still not knowing which area to follow due to the large flood of new information being bombarded in my head (programming languages, concepts, tools, etc.), a whole new world.

I did some internships at the university in the areas of technical support and development.

I am always striving to understand and put into practice the greatest number of different tools and technologies, always aiming at knowledge, which is indispensable, regardless of the area in which it operates.
